The basic API is described by deck.py, machine.py, etc at the top of
the package tree. The packages are alternate implementations that are
extensions, or maybe just different low-level design choices.

For example, chinese-sql loads data from an sqlite3 data base, but
otherwise manages the game state with python lists.
