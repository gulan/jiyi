Goals
-----
Many flash card programs clutter the presentation with distracting
information. But any kind of distraction impedes the learning to be
done. Jiyi (pronounced gee-ee) will show you only the text of the card
that you are learning.

Model
-----
Jiyi follows a physical model of flash card play. Imagine that you are
sitting at a table with a newly sorted deck of flash cards (called the
draw deck). Each card has a question on the front, and the question
and the answer on the back. The play proceeds as follows.

1. You draw the top card from the draw deck, read the question, and
   try to recall the answer.

2. You flip the card over and compare your answer with the card's.

3. If you think you know the card well enough, you toss it on the
   discard pile. Cards in the discard pile will not be looked at again
   during the course of the game.

4. If you could not remember the answer quickly, put the card in the
   review pile.

5. After a time, up to you, you can restack the cards. This means that
   you shuffle the cards in the review pile, and place them on top of the
   draw deck. Play then resumes as before, but of course you will first
   see the review cards before proceeding to any new ones.

6. The game is over when all of the cards are in the discard pile.
